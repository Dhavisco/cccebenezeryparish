                            God called Rev., Pastor, Prophet Oshoffa on the day of total Eclipse of the sun in West Africa, when he was in the forest of Dahomey (now Republic of Benin), to purchase Ebony wood being a carpenter and timber trader, just like his father.  
                            He was in the wilderness for forty days and forty nights.  
                            Just as our Lord Jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness for forty days and forty nights.

                            “It is the wish of God to send you on an errand of preaching into the World.   
                            Many nominal Christians there who were confronted by difficulties and problems of this world.  
                            They run after fetish priests and other power of darkness for all kinds of assistance.  
                            Consequently, on their death, they cannot see Christ because, by their action, Satan has left his spiritual mark on them.  
                            To assist you in in your work so that men may listen to the fact that God has sent you.”

                        <p>We hope the good Lord who has called you into this fold will neither desert or forsake you.  And as you tread on through the corridors of life, now armed with the gift bestowed upon you by God through this church, remember that; &#8220;in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>For neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
                        <p>May God Bless you as you come (Amen).</p>
